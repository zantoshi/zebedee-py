# zebedee-python-lib
A python library that makes building with the ZBD API easy and fast. To sign-up for the ZBD API, use https://dashboard.zebedee.io .

To get started, you'll need to create a project using using the Developer Dashboard. Once you have a project, grab the API key from the API key tab. We will now assume that you have an API Key.

## features
The ZBD class has the following methods:

- get_wallet_details(): retrieves details of the user's wallet
create_charge(amount_of_seconds_to_expire_after, amount_msats, description, internal_id=None): creates a charge request with the specified parameters

- get_charge_details(zbd_id): retrieves details of a charge request with the specified ID
create_static_charge(allowedSlots, min_amount_msats, max_amount_msats, description, internal_id, success_message): creates a static charge request with the specified parameters

- update_static_charge_details(min_amount_msats, max_amount_msats, description, success_message, allowed_slots=None): updates the details of a static charge request with the specified ID

- get_static_charge_details(zbd_id): retrieves details of a static charge request with the specified ID
create_withdrawal_request(amount_of_seconds_to_expire_after, amount_msats, description, internal_id): creates a withdrawal request with the specified parameters

- get_withdrawal_request_details(zbd_id): retrieves details of a withdrawal request with the specified ID
send_keysend_payment(public_key, amount_msats, metadata=None, tlv_records=None): sends a keysend payment with the specified parameters

- pay_invoice(invoice, description, internal_id, amount=None): pays an invoice with the specified parameters.

- & much more!

## example usage
Install the package using:
`pip install zebedee`

Now you're ready to get started!

```
from zebedee import *

# create a new ZBD object with callback URL to get updates after there is a status update.
project_a = zebedee.Project("your_api_key", "https://your-website.com/zbd/webhook/")

# fetch a charge for a lightning address
charge_response = project_a.fetch_charge_from_lightning_address(
    lightning_address="santos@zbd.gg", amount_msats=10000, description="charge description"
)

# send a payment to a gamertag
gamertag_payment_details = project_a.send_payment_to_gamertag(gamertag="santos", amount_msats=1000, description="payment description")

# get details for a gamertag transaction with zbd_id=123
transaction_details = project_a.get_gamertag_transaction_details(zbd_id=gamertag_payment_details["transactionId"])

# get the user ID associated with a gamertag
user_id = project_a.get_user_id_from_gamertag(gamertag="santos")

# get the gamertag associated with a user ID
gamertag = project_a.get_gamertag_from_user_id(user_id=user_id)

# fetch a charge for a gamertag
charge_response = project_a.fetch_charge_from_gamertag(
    gamertag="santos", amount_msats=1000, description="charge description", internal_id="internal_id"
)

# check if an IP is in a supported region
supported = project_a.is_supported_region(ip="123.45.67.89")

# get the IP address of the ZBD production server
prod_server_ip = project_a.get_zbd_prod_server_ip()

# get the current BTC-USD exchange rate
btc_usd_price = project_a.get_btc_usd_quote_price()

# convert sats to msats
amount_msats = project_a.convert_sats_to_msats(amount_sats=1000)

# convert msats to sats
amount_sats = project_a.convert_msats_to_sats(amount_msats=1)

# transfer funds between ZBD wallets
transfer_response = project_a.transfer_zbd_funds(amount_msats=1000, recevier_wallet_id="receiver_wallet_id")
```

## best practices

- use an environmental variable for each apikey before going live with this code.
